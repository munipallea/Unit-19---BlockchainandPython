# Multi-Blockchain Wallet in Python
Submitted by Amar Munipalle
## Dependencies

Due to native difficulties on geth the final deployment could not be completed. The Jupyter notebook includes 'Proof of Work' for the enture body of work completed and attests to the validity of the code. The Ether balances have been printed and in addition a complete set of wallet keys generated.

Technical difficulties include:
* Lack of robust bitcoin faucets
* Inability to link HD-DERIVE keys and geth despite multiple attempts
* Inability of BTC Test faucets to fund HD-DERIVE based addresses

The code is robust and will function in a non test environment.

## GETH issues

Once the PoA network is up and running, it is impossible to reset the genesis block with bew keys generated by hd-derive. As the genesis block is incompatible
